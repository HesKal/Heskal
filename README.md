## 🚀 About Me

I am a detail-oriented and highly motivated data enthusiast currently pursuing my degree in Information Systems. My journey is driven by a deep curiosity to understand the stories hidden within data and to use technology to solve real-world problems. I thrive at the intersection of data engineering, statistical analysis, and machine learning, with a special love for creating elegant, efficient, and impactful solutions.

*   🔭 I’m currently diving deep into **Big Data technologies** and **advanced Data Mining techniques**.
*   🌱 I’m passionate about learning and constantly exploring new tools and methodologies in the AI/ML space.
*   💬 Ask me about **Python for data science**, **database design**, or **building predictive models**.
*   🎨 Beyond the code, I have a keen eye for design and believe that a well-presented analysis is just as important as the analysis itself.
